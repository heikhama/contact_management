# contact_management

Creating a command-line based contacts management system in Python is a great project for learning about file handling, user input, and basic data manipulation. Below is a simple implementation of such a system that allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts using a text file to store the data. Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run this code.
This code creates a simple command-line interface for managing contacts. Contacts are stored in a text file called "contacts.txt". Users can add, view, update, and delete contacts, and changes are saved to the file. Make sure to place this code in a Python file and run it in your command-line environment to use the contacts management system.
